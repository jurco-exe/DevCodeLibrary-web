        I had this project in my mind for a long time, but only this day I
        started programming this project. The reason why I didn't start sooner
        was because of schoolwork, project preparation, other unfinished
        projects for school / for me, learning some technologies to build this
        project etc.... Now we can go to the content and description of this
        project. DevCodeLibrary is designed for people who want to start
        learning programming. From kids to grandparents we have all categories
        for them, which contain groups of different levels. I created
        DevCodeLibrary because when I started programming I didn't know where to
        start, what direction to focus and stay, simple questions, tests or
        challenges to test my programming knowledge. Yes, this is a site for
        those but also for those who want to improve because as I said it is
        designed for every level. And it works by storing videos of possible
        tutorials that would be most effective for learning programming. Of
        course we will also have our Tips, Tricks, Tutorials etc. but for now it
        will be like a big repository of Tutorials that we think are the most
        effective for learning. We don't want to offend anyone in advance if
        their video is not on our site, but also if you have a problem with your
        video being on our site you should contact us. The project is still in
        the process of rebuilding so don't be surprised if there will be less
        problems with the connection to the site. Translated with
